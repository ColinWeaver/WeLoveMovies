# WeLoveMovies

Description: This was a backend project assigned to me by the software Program I am currently enrolled in. Some of the repository was already written. I added
the migration files, some of the error handling, and the necessary route features for movies, reviews, theaters. I also added some features in app.js and server.js.
To write the routes I used Knex queries and async handlers.
